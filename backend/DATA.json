Only GitLab enables Concurrent DevOps, unlocking organizations from the constraints of today’s toolchain. GitLab provides unmatched visibility, radical new levels of efficiency and comprehensive governance to significantly compress the time between planning a change and monitoring its effect. This makes the software lifecycle 200% faster, radically improving the speed of business.\r\n\r\nGitLab and Concurrent DevOps collapses cycle times by driving higher efficiency across all stages of the software development lifecycle.

    "long_description": "The journey of building Razorpay started in 2014, when Harshil Mathur (CEO & Co-Founder) and Shashank Kumar (MD & Co-Founder) witnessed the dismal state of the online payments industry in India then and understood that they have a larger and more important issue to solve. And That was democratizing online payments for Indian businesses, particularly the underserved market, Startups and SMEs. Over the last 9 years, Razorpay has evolved from a single-product company to a multi-product company, from an online payment gateway to India’s only full-stack financial solutions company, offering payments and banking solutions to businesses.  Razorpay today is transforming age-old complexities and changing every known paradigm of money movement for disruptive businesses.\r\n\r\nOver the last couple of years, Razorpay’s growth has evolved to be an index of India’s digital economy. From a kirana shop in Kashmir collecting payments on our POS device to a textile exporter in Kanyakumari accepting dollars through our International Payments product, Razorpay has revolutionised how businesses have traditionally transacted and interacted with money. \r\n\r\nRazorpay became the first and only Indian fintech to build a full-stack international Payment Gateway ‘Curlec by Razorpay’ and evolved into a comprehensive provider of payment solutions, leveraging the synergy between cutting-edge technological capabilities and a profound understanding of the local payment ecosystem. The introduction of the new Curlec Payment Gateway aims to cater to a wide spectrum of businesses, expanding its reach to over 5,000 establishments. \r\n\r\nBe it for international expansion or solving for Indian businesses, for Razorpay, the customer has always been at the core of all disruption, from addressing evolving needs to delivering new solutions. This hyperfocus helped bring Razorpay’s several industry-first innovations into the market since 2014. Razorpay became the first to launch a completely digital on-boarding process for startups, first to launch support for UPI, first to launch support for Bharath QR, first to introduce recurring payments for businesses through Razorpay Route, automating payment receipts and later automate payouts and making the entire process seamless and optimized and many more were introduced aling the way. Other firsts include: - First to launch India’s Multi-Network Tokenisation solution, TokenHQ - Razorpay became India’s first payment gateway to support credit cards on UPI - Razorpay also became India’s largest omnichannel payment gateway for businesses post acquiring Ezetap which is India’s leading offline POS company that was founded with the aim to simplify the in-person offline payments experience.\r\n\r\nOver the years, Razorpay’s valuation has jumped from $1 billion to $7.5 billion and has added a host of marquee investors to its captable. Razorpay is also the second Indian company to be a part of Silicon Valley’s largest tech accelerator, Y Combinator. Marquee investors such as Lone Pine Capital, Alkeon Capital, TCV, GIC, Tiger Global, Sequoia Capital India, Ribbit Capital, Matrix Partners, Salesforce Ventures, Y Combinator, and MasterCard have invested a total of $741.5 Mn through Series A, B, C, D, E and F funding. The last financing round of Series F led the company’s valuation to $7.5 Billion signaling one of the fastest increases in valuation for an Indian Unicorn. \r\n\r\nRazorpay has also made acquisitions with like-minded companies over the last 9 years. In total, till date, Razorpay has made eight acquisitions, Billme in 2023 - A Digital invoice and customer Engagement, Ezetap in 2022 - India’s leading offline POS company, PoshVine in 2022 - India’s leading loyalty and reward management platform, IZealiant in 2022 - A mobile-first, API-enabled, and cloud-ready payment solution and made its first international foray in South-East Asia by announcing its acquisition of Curlec in 2022 - A recurring payments platform. TeraFin Labs in 2021 - the AI-based SaaS platform that facilitates digital financing solutions, Opfin (Now RazorpayX Payroll) in 2019 -  The payroll management solution and Thirdwatch in 2019, the first acquisition - The AI-powered fraud detection platform.\r\n\r\nAll these efforts are being done in collaboration with banks, regulators, and stakeholders so that India can build a better place for small and big businesses. Today, Razorpay powers online payments for 76 Of 100 startup unicorns and millions of businesses in India. The core premise of what Razorpay was founded in 2014 and what it is today hasn’t changed. It is to make money movement simpler and easier, whether it is for businesses to receive money, send money, or manage money. \r\n\r\n",

Our mission is to make clean drinking water available to everyone, everywhere.\r\n\r\nWe create stainless steel water bottles, and each bottle funds 5 years of clean water for someone in Africa. When you get a GiveMeTap bottle, you also have access to the free-water network of cafes and shops who give free tap water to people on the go. No questions, no hassle.\r\n\r\nWe build water projects in remote villages and elect a water committee to run the maintenance of the water. So far we have made an impact in Namibia, Malawi, and Ghana to bring clean water for the first time.\r\n\r\nWe like to think of this as ‘Water for You, Water for Everyone’.\r\n\r\nWe help awesome companies create custom bottles for their staff, customers, and events so that they can stay hydrated, reduce plastic waste and help fund water projects. Our partners include:\r\n\r\nDeloitte\r\nHSBC\r\nYCombinator\r\nGoogle\r\nTED\r\nFlexport\r\nLegal & General\r\nRichard Branson's The Lodge, Switzerland\r\nCambridge University \r\n\r\nWant to get your company involved?

The three co-founders graduated in Data Science and AI from institutions like MIT, Ecole Polytechnique and HEC Paris.\r\n",

Even if they know, the latest AI tools constantly update, and change very fast, it’s difficult for the average developer to stay up to date (most developers still use the unpaid version of ChatGPT!).\r\n- For power users of AI tools, which are a small minority, they have to subscribe to multiple AI tools (Perplexity, ChatGPT, Claude, Cursor, etc.), each that do better at specific use cases. This causes overspending, additional context switching during workflows, and simply the inconvenience of managing multiple not fully utilized pricy subscriptions.\r\n- Enterprises also require more privacy safety which closed source AI tooling does not provide.

This means entire cities can affordably upgrade their infrastructure - and some already are. We are live in multiple Texas cities, with both ongoing and successful pilots, corridors of multiple intersections, and soon to be entire cities.

With Pipeshift, companies making >1000 calls/day on frontier LLMs can use their data and logs to replace GPT/Claude in production with specialized LLMs that offer higher accuracy, lower latencies, and model ownership.\r\n\r\nWe are experts in LLMs, having scaled LLMs to 1000s of users in 2023. That's when we saw the massive drawbacks of closed-source LLMs in production, making us start Pipeshift. We met 6 years back as roommates during undergrad, and before starting Pipeshift, we led a defense robotics non-profit backed by NVIDIA and built a health-tech startup.\r\n\r\nThe shift to AI is like the shift to the cloud, every company is going to implement AI. And, open-source AI will be as good as closed-source AI. Meta's Llama 3.1 models prove that. But, the open-source AI stack is a complete mess, with companies needing a team of engineers to set up 10+ different tools just to get started and every optimization needs countless engineering hours.\r\n\r\nPipeshift offers this stack out of the box. With our fine-tuning + distilling platform and one-click deployment stack for hosting these LLMs, we ensure 10x faster experimentation cycles and time-to-production.

        "value": "Pipeshift is the \"Vercel for open-source LLMs\", offering a platform for finetuning, distilling, and inferencing open-source LLMs for engineering teams to get to production with their LLMs 10x faster. With Pipeshift, companies making >1000 calls/day on frontier LLMs can use their data and logs to replace GPT/Claude in production with specialized LLMs that offer higher accuracy, lower latencies, and model ownership.\r\n\r\nWe are experts in LLMs, having scaled LLMs to 1000s of users in 2023. That's when we saw the massive drawbacks of closed-source LLMs in production, making us start Pipeshift. We met 6 years back as roommates during undergrad, and before starting Pipeshift, we led a defense robotics non-profit backed by NVIDIA and built a health-tech startup.\r\n\r\nThe shift to AI is like the shift to the cloud, every company is going to implement AI. And, open-source AI will be as good as closed-source AI. Meta's Llama 3.1 models prove that. But, the open-source AI stack is a complete mess, with companies needing a team of engineers to set up 10+ different tools just to get started and every optimization needs countless engineering hours.\r\n\r\nPipeshift offers this stack out of the box. With our fine-tuning + distilling platform and one-click deployment stack for hosting these LLMs, we ensure 10x faster experimentation cycles and time-to-production. Think \"Vercel for open-source LLMs\".",

We focus on robust hardware and user-friendly software for a new generation of end-users, ensuring ease of use and rapid deployment.\r\n\r\nSecure and efficient handling of user data can make customers in the manufacturing space nervous to invest in sensing — our team's extensive experience handling self-driving car data in these regulated environments positions us uniquely to tackle these challenges. Companies like Keyence, National Instruments, and FLIR offer either outdated hardware or prohibitively expensive systems, along with software that hasn’t evolved to meet modern user needs.\r\n\r\nUS manufacturing is undergoing a significant transformation, with construction spending hitting a record annualized pace of over $200 billion. The need for a more reliable supply chain has seen over $700 billion in manufacturing megaprojects across North America since 2021, and this growth requires heavy automation. Bucket Robotics is at the forefront of this shift, offering a scalable, cost-effective solution that enhances automation and positions manufacturers closer to their end customers.",

        "value": "250M lbs of plastic is wasted annually in US manufacturing. Bucket Robotics is making defect detection faster and easier to deploy to prevent that.\r\n\r\nOur products are designed to be easy to integrate into existing automation and technology stacks, flexible enough to bring retooling costs down, and reliable enough to make you forget that it's a robot.\r\n\r\nMatt and Steph are leveraging their experience from the self-driving industry, where we've integrated high-performance computing and quality sensing into complex, noise-filled environments. We focus on robust hardware and user-friendly software for a new generation of end-users, ensuring ease of use and rapid deployment.\r\n\r\nSecure and efficient handling of user data can make customers in the manufacturing space nervous to invest in sensing — our team's extensive experience handling self-driving car data in these regulated environments positions us uniquely to tackle these challenges. Companies like Keyence, National Instruments, and FLIR offer either outdated hardware or prohibitively expensive systems, along with software that hasn’t evolved to meet modern user needs.\r\n\r\nUS manufacturing is undergoing a significant transformation, with construction spending hitting a record annualized pace of over $200 billion. The need for a more reliable supply chain has seen over $700 billion in manufacturing megaprojects across North America since 2021, and this growth requires heavy automation. Bucket Robotics is at the forefront of this shift, offering a scalable, cost-effective solution that enhances automation and positions manufacturers closer to their end customers.",

By combining top industry expertise with the latest in AI and fintech, we provide real-time financial insights, strategic community planning, and automated operations.\r\n\r\nLike many homeowners, Shreyas and Allen experienced frustrations with HOAs. Our investigation revealed that most HOA management companies are outdated mom-and-pop operations nearing retirement, resistant to adopting new technology. Furthermore, these companies often prioritize relationships with vendors and banks over the interests of the communities they serve, leading to misaligned incentives. Realizing this, we knew that to achieve our mission of fixing HOAs, Assembly HOA had to be vertically integrated.\r\n\r\nWe are live with over 39 communities in Greater Los Angeles and SF Bay Area.

HOA boards choose Assembly to replace their existing management company, ensuring excellent service and clear visibility into their HOA’s finances and operations. With Assembly, community priorities are always addressed, and homeowners can easily understand what their HOA is doing and how their monthly dues are being used.\r\n\r\nOur mission is to create turnkey communities and protect property values through transparent, efficient, and proactive management. By combining top industry expertise with the latest in AI and fintech, we provide real-time financial insights, strategic community planning, and automated operations.\r\n\r\nLike many homeowners, Shreyas and Allen experienced frustrations with HOAs. Our investigation revealed that most HOA management companies are outdated mom-and-pop operations nearing retirement, resistant to adopting new technology. Furthermore, these companies often prioritize relationships with vendors and banks over the interests of the communities they serve, leading to misaligned incentives. Realizing this, we knew that to achieve our mission of fixing HOAs, Assembly HOA had to be vertically integrated.\r\n\r\nWe are live with over 39 communities in Greater Los Angeles and SF Bay Area.

By optimizing for each AI architecture, we significantly boost both inference and training speeds while reducing energy consumption.\r\n\r\nImagine having hardware tailored to your AI model, whilst still maintaining the flexibility of a GPU. This way, you won't need to re-manufacture your hardware each time you change your model architecture, all while still benefiting from the speed and efficiency of specialized hardware, saving data centers and compute clusters hundreds of millions of dollars every year!",

With our tool, advisors can:\r\n- Identify prospects within their target niche, aggregating thousands of data points per lead\r\n- Prioritize prospects based on their predicted likelihood of converting, a score unique to each advisor and prospect pair\r\n- Automate the outreach and meeting scheduling with their high priority prospects\r\n\r\nIn essence, doing all the work for the advisors, and letting them focus on what actually matters, the client relationship.",

Advisors often waste 60 hours of business development to convert 1 new client.  \r\n\r\nAt FINNY, we are certain we can do better with AI. With our tool, advisors can:\r\n- Identify prospects within their target niche, aggregating thousands of data points per lead\r\n- Prioritize prospects based on their predicted likelihood of converting, a score unique to each advisor and prospect pair\r\n- Automate the outreach and meeting scheduling with their high priority prospects\r\n\r\nIn essence, doing all the work for the advisors, and letting them focus on what actually matters, the client relationship.",

Saturn creates the best version of truth, empowering investment advisors to work more efficiently, navigate complex regulatory landscapes, and deliver personalised, high-value services to their clients.\r\n\r\nToday, Saturn supports over 200 firms globally that manage more than £35bn in assets under management (AUM) and over 200,000 clients.\r\n\r\nAs the industry grows, it faces massive operational challenges like bad tech, advisor retirements, regulatory pressure, an increased cost base, and transformational opportunities like great intergenerational wealth transfer and changing consumer needs.\r\n\r\nSaturn aims to be at the forefront of this transformation, driving the future of wealth management.",

For example, if a user asked an AI agent to buy a book on an e-commerce site, we handle the purchase via our Purchasing API. \r\n\r\nAI agents are poised to elevate the way we shop, but they aren’t reliably making purchases today. We’re changing that by bringing uniformity to non-uniform checkout flows across the internet.\r\n\r\nOur expertise is at the intersection of payments and e-commerce. Angelica was a staff engineer at Stripe, driving API evolution, design, and governance across payments products. Scott was a senior investor at Sycamore Partners, investing in and partnering with leading consumer companies. \r\n\r\nOur solution will enable AI agents to make payments of every kind, including e-commerce (e.g., Amazon, eBay), consumer services (e.g., Uber, DoorDash), and B2B (e.g., supplier payment). In the US e-commerce market alone, there are 10B transactions every year, representing a significant opportunity for us. We have already onboarded multiple AI agent customers who have thousands of monthly users and have begun integrating them to power their e-commerce purchases. ",

        "value": "We make it easy for AI agents to buy anything on the internet. For example, if a user asked an AI agent to buy a book on an e-commerce site, we handle the purchase via our Purchasing API. \r\n\r\nAI agents are poised to elevate the way we shop, but they aren’t reliably making purchases today. We’re changing that by bringing uniformity to non-uniform checkout flows across the internet.\r\n\r\nOur expertise is at the intersection of payments and e-commerce. Angelica was a staff engineer at Stripe, driving API evolution, design, and governance across payments products. Scott was a senior investor at Sycamore Partners, investing in and partnering with leading consumer companies. \r\n\r\nOur solution will enable AI agents to make payments of every kind, including e-commerce (e.g., Amazon, eBay), consumer services (e.g., Uber, DoorDash), and B2B (e.g., supplier payment). In the US e-commerce market alone, there are 10B transactions every year, representing a significant opportunity for us. We have already onboarded multiple AI agent customers who have thousands of monthly users and have begun integrating them to power their e-commerce purchases. ",

In addition, our drugs have a unique delivery mechanism known as hypoxia-activated prodrugs (HAPs). HAPs are drugs designed to become active in a hypoxic (low oxygen) environment, which is a hallmark of the majority of solid tumors.

More than half of the cost of a rooftop solar project comes from soft costs. We started Aether with the sole aim of reducing solar soft costs. \r\n\r\nOur vision: Aether will be a big player in the young and emerging Solar software vertical, which has a projected 20B Global TAM up for grabs by 2025.",

Unlock hidden revenue in their customer data (e.g., Underwriting teams use Trellis to extract key features from transaction data and build better risk models.)\r\n2. Supercharge RAG applications by enabling end-users to ask analytical questions not possible before with traditional Vector DB (e.g., what are the top three features that users are requesting)\r\n3. Enrich their data warehouse with business-critical information (e.g., Retrieving detailed pricing and quantity information of products sold on competitor websites)",

    "long_description": "Fiber AI automates SDR and BDR prospecting & outbound sales workflows using AI. Enterprises choose our AI sales platform because we automatically find prospects, research them, and hyper-personalize outbound messages that get 80% open rates, which is 4x the industry standard (our AISDR / AIBDR platform 2-4x's the reply rates you are currently getting).\r\n\r\n\r\nOur AI sales platform consists of 3 core components:\r\n\r\nFirst, Fiber AI manages domain and email health to achieve 80% open rates. We configure cold email infrastructure to maximize email deliverability. Our product will automatically configure your DNS records, warm up your emails (email warmup), orchestrate emails to send optimally across all your accounts, run multi-layer email bounce detection (email waterfall), and modify each outgoing cold outreach to ensure your cold outbound sales emails don't trigger spam filters.\r\n\r\n\r\nSecond, we automate sales lead generation with dynamic audiences (AI powered sales assistant, AI based SDR). We have B2B company data on 60 million B2B companies and 800 million B2B contacts, sourced from dozens of data providers (i.e. think sources like BuiltWith, Crunchbase, LinkedIn, ZoomInfo, SemRush, Apollo data, and more). This allows you to precisely segment your audience by the companies you care about and exclude everyone else. Our audiences are dynamic (i.e., account based marketing, account based sales, ABM), meaning we continuously look for prospects matching your targeting criteria and add them to your audience to run our automated outbound sales sequences. This automates manual workflows you might be running on platforms like Clay or Persana. You can also create an audience once based on intent signals (i.e., GTM or go-to-market signals, sales intelligence) and put your outreach on autopilot.\r\n\r\n\r\nLastly, our AI sales copilot (AI sales agent, AI based BDR) enables AI powered hyper-personalized emails that boost response rates. The biggest debate in sales is choosing between relevancy and personalization—now you don’t have to. We search far and wide to find the “golden nugget” of information to connect with your prospect, and then use GPT-4 to write hyper personalized email sequences that dramatically increase reply rates and book meetings.\r\n\r\n\r\nBecause of these core differences, we stand out from competitors. Products like apollo io have poor email deliverability rates that ruin email health long-term. Existing email outbound tools like amplemarket, reply io, marketo, and outreach io don't scale well and restrict you to small volumes of outbound emails. AI features to autopilot campaigns are missing in products like smartlead ai, instantly, unify gtm, penguin ai, and warmly ai. Currently, our philosophy is to allow AI to 100-1000x your team's output while maintaining extremely high email quality. AI sales copilots like reggie ai, aisdr, artisan ai / artisan sdr / artisan bdr, and others let gpt use AI to generate the entire email, which results in poor outbound email quality since SDRs/BDRs don't have fine-tune controls on the personalization.",

Enterprises choose our AI sales platform because we automatically find prospects, research them, and hyper-personalize outbound messages that get 80% open rates, which is 4x the industry standard (our AISDR / AIBDR platform 2-4x's the reply rates you are currently getting).\r\n\r\n\r\nOur AI sales platform consists of 3 core components:\r\n\r\nFirst, Fiber AI manages domain and email health to achieve 80% open rates. We configure cold email infrastructure to maximize email deliverability. Our product will automatically configure your DNS records, warm up your emails (email warmup), orchestrate emails to send optimally across all your accounts, run multi-layer email bounce detection (email waterfall), and modify each outgoing cold outreach to ensure your cold outbound sales emails don't trigger spam filters.\r\n\r\n\r\nSecond, we automate sales lead generation with dynamic audiences (AI powered sales assistant, AI based SDR). We have B2B company data on 60 million B2B companies and 800 million B2B contacts, sourced from dozens of data providers (i.e. think sources like BuiltWith, Crunchbase, LinkedIn, ZoomInfo, SemRush, Apollo data, and more). This allows you to precisely segment your audience by the companies you care about and exclude everyone else. Our audiences are dynamic (i.e., account based marketing, account based sales, ABM), meaning we continuously look for prospects matching your targeting criteria and add them to your audience to run our automated outbound sales sequences. This automates manual workflows you might be running on platforms like Clay or Persana. You can also create an audience once based on intent signals (i.e., GTM or go-to-market signals, sales intelligence) and put your outreach on autopilot.\r\n\r\n\r\nLastly, our AI sales copilot (AI sales agent, AI based BDR) enables AI powered hyper-personalized emails that boost response rates. The biggest debate in sales is choosing between relevancy and personalization—now you don’t have to. We search far and wide to find the “golden nugget” of information to connect with your prospect, and then use GPT-4 to write hyper personalized email sequences that dramatically increase reply rates and book meetings.\r\n\r\n\r\nBecause of these core differences, we stand out from competitors. Products like apollo io have poor email deliverability rates that ruin email health long-term. Existing email outbound tools like amplemarket, reply io, marketo, and outreach io don't scale well and restrict you to small volumes of outbound emails. AI features to autopilot campaigns are missing in products like smartlead ai, instantly, unify gtm, penguin ai, and warmly ai. Currently, our philosophy is to allow AI to 100-1000x your team's output while maintaining extremely high email quality. AI sales copilots like reggie ai, aisdr, artisan ai / artisan sdr / artisan bdr, and others let gpt use AI to generate the entire email, which results in poor outbound email quality since SDRs/BDRs don't have fine-tune controls on the personalization.",

There's quite a few payors in both medical and dental (e.g. Seledent) that have yet to offer a digital retrieval of benefits\r\n- We're reliable and consistent -- there is no person-to-person variation or question skipping when it comes to working with software\r\n",
