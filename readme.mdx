# IdeaPulse

IdeaPulse is a web application that allows users to quickly check if ideas similar to theirs have been funded by Y Combinator (YC). The tool utilizes React.js, Vite, LangChain, and Vector Store to provide an efficient and user-friendly experience. Users can input their ideas, and the application will search through a database of funded projects to find relevant matches.
